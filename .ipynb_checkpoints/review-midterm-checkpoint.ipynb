    "- Recall that variables in Python are names (or identifiers) bound to objects (things in memory)\n",
    "- Variables do not need to be declared, but instead are created when initialized\n",
    "- Assignment via the '=' operator binds a name on the left to an object on the right, e.g., x = \"hello\" binds the variable x to the word \"hello\". Assignment such as x=y binds the variable x to the same object as y is bound to, i.e., x and y at the current time are different names for the same object. The assignment operator never copies data!\n",
    "- Certain objects are immutable (their value cannot be changed, e.g., ints)) while others are mutable (their value can be changed, e.g., lists). To change a mutable object a mutation has to be called via one of its names, e.g., x.append(3), says append 3 to the object (a list) which x is bound to."

A function or class method creates a local scope when it is called, which consists of a set of local variables which exist only during the runtime of the function. Python is often referred to as having function level scoping: unlike C++, local scope are not created for if statements, while loops or for loops (C++ is often referred to as having block level scoping).\n",
    "- When a variable, e.g., x, is referenced in Python has to have some way of resolving which variable x you are referring to.

The distinction between instance and class variables are quite artificial, but one can think of all class instances must have the class variable, but don't necessarily have to have the same instance variables.
