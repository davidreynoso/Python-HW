    "In this worksheet, you'll implement a `recipe` class that stores data on how to create a tasty dish--like cookies!--in a structured way. We'll build on this `recipe` class in a future Discussion activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Schematically, a recipe has three primary pieces of data: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A title (e.g. \"Cookies\")\n",
    "2. A list of ingredients, with quantities. Example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "    Flour (grams)  : 400\n",
    "    Butter (grams) : 200\n",
    "    Salt (grams)   : 10\n",
    "    Sugar (grams)  : 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. A list of directions. Example: \n",
    "    \n",
    "> 1. In a large mixing bowl, cut the chilled butter into the flour and sugar. \n",
    "> 2. Add the salt and sugar, and combine. \n",
    "> 3. Roll into a log, and freeze. \n",
    "> 4. Preheat the oven to 200 C°. \n",
    "> 5. Cut the log of dough into thin disks and place on baking sheet. \n",
    "> 6. Bake for 12 minutes, flipping after 7 minutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our `recipe` class will store such data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, it is not necessary to copy/paste the code that corresponds to your class. Rather, you can keep all the code for your class in Part A, and then just run the tests in the subsequent parts to verify that your code is working. \n",
    "\n",
