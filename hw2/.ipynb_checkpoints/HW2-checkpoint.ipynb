    "Many of you may have encountered the output of machine learning models which, when \"seeded\" with a small amount of text, produce a larger corpus of text which is expected to be similar or relevant to the seed text. For example, there's been a lot of buzz about the new [GPT-3 model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), related to its [carbon footprint](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/06/17/deep-learnings-climate-change-problem/#2781c1b16b43), [bigoted tendencies](https://medium.com/fair-bytes/how-biased-is-gpt-3-5b2b91f1177), and, yes, impressive (and often [humorous](https://aiweirdness.com/)) [ability to replicate human-like text in response to prompts.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/) \n",

    "We are not going to program a complicated deep learning model, but we will construct a much simpler language model that performs a similar task. Using tools like iteration and dictionaries, we will create a family of **Markov language models** for generating text. For the purposes of this assignment, an $n$-th order Markov model is a function that constructs a string of text one letter at a time, using only knowledge of the most recent $n$ letters. You can think of it as a writer with a \"memory\" of $n$ letters. \n"

    "\n",
    "The starting `n`-gram can be selected at random, or the user can specify it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Generate Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we generate text one character at a time. To do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at the most recent `n` characters in our generated text. Say that `n = 3` and the 3 most recent character are `the`. \n",
    "2. We then look at our list of `n+1`-grams, and focus on grams whose first `n` characters match. Examples matching `the` include `them`, `the `, `thei`, and so on. \n",
    "3. We pick a random one of these `n+1`-grams, weighted according to its number of occurrences. \n",
    "4. The final character of this new `n+1` gram is our next letter. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if there are 3 occurrences of `them`, 4 occurrences of `the `, and 1 occurrences of `thei` in the n-gram dictionary, then our next character is `m` with probabiliy 3/8, `[space]` with probability 1/2, and `i` with probability `1/8`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: the ***3rd***-order model requires you to compute ***4***-grams. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What you should do\n",

    "Write a function `markov_text` that generates synthetic text according to an `n`-th order Markov model. It should have the following arguments: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `s`, the input string of real text. \n",
    "- `n`, the order of the model. \n",
    "- `length`, the size of the text to generate. Use a default value of 100. \n",
    "-  `seed`, the initial string that gets the Markov model started. I used `\"Emma Woodhouse\"` (the full name of the protagonist of the novel) as my `seed`, but any subset of `s` of length `n` or larger will work. \n",

    "## Notes and Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint***: A good function for performing the random choice is the `choices()` function in the `random` module. You can use it like this: \n",

    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "['One'] # output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and second arguments must be lists of equal length. Note also that the return value is a list -- if you want the value *in* the list, you need to get it out via indexing.  \n",
    "\n",
