    "\n",
    "These names are enclosed in HTML `<a>` tags, with a special variable `NAME=speechNUM` (where `NUM` can be any positive integer). Within the `<a>` tags are also `<b>` tags. In some cases, the first `A` in the opening HTML tag may be capitalized. Here are four examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `<A NAME=speech1><b>BERNARDO</b></a>`\n",
    "- `<A NAME=speech2><b>FRANCISCO</b></a>`\n",
    "- `<A NAME=speech34><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>`\n",
    "- `<A NAME=speech197><b>First Ambassador</b></a>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a regular expression called `pattern` that (a) matches the complete string in each example above and (b) captures the name itself within a group. You should not capture any of the additional HTML tags. Feel free to take the list of examples above, and paste it in [Pythex](https://pythex.org/) to experiment with your expression. Once you've settled on your solution, import the `re` module and use `re.findall` to obtain all character names. At this stage, you should have repeats: for example, there are 23 distinct speeches by the character `BERNARDO`. Save your results as a list called `speeches`. "
